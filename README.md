PyQt top title bar widget for frameless window

## Requirements

## Note
If something goes wrong about this please contact me. 

I had accidentally done all procedure from ```git init``` to ```git push``` in wrong directory so i fixed it. 

But i don't know what kind of hidden impacts will occur. 

I don't want to delete the whole online repository by this, because i believe that deleting repository caused bad influence. 

It's just a hunch, though.
